## Register

This crate is based on the register macro used in the 
[enc28j60](https://github.com/japaric/enc28j60) driver implementation.
I figured it might be useful to have it as a separate macro.

## Examples
For example usage see the [enc28j60](https://github.com/japaric/enc28j60) 
driver implementation or in the near future in 
the [rfm12b](https://github.com/Sawchord/rfm12b) driver.
